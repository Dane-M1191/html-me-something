                <p>When Halo: Combat Evolved was first released in 2001, it became a hit almost instantly. The game captured the hearts and minds of hardcore gamers and science fiction enthusiasts alike.

                <p>As mentioned above, the foundations of Halo lore began with the game, "Halo: Combat evolved". The setting introduced here is one of desperation and perseverance. Throughtout the entirety of the game, we didnt know much, but it was clear: humanity has been at war, and they have been losing badly.</p>
                <p>The game begins with a naval spaceship, The Pillar of Autumn, coming into contact with a strange and inconcieveable mega-structure, Halo. </p>
